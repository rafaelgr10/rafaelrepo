BASH SCRIPTING BASICS
1. #!/bin/bash
This line at the top tells Linux to use the Bash shell to run the script.

2. echo
echo prints text to the screen.
Example:

bash
echo "Hello, World!"

This will display Hello, World! in the terminal.

3. read
read takes input from the user and saves it in a variable.
Example:

bash
echo "Enter your name:"
read name
echo "Hello, $name!"

This will ask for a name, store it in name, and then greet the user.

4. Variable
A variable is a way to store data, like a piece of text or a number, that you want to use later.

5. Declaring a Variable
Declare a variable by typing its name, followed by = and the value (no spaces around =).

Example:
bash
favorite_color="blue"

6. Using a Variable
To use (or "call") a variable, type $ before the variable’s name.

Example:
bash
echo "My favorite color is $favorite_color"
Example Script Using These Concepts
Here’s a simple script that ties these all together:

bash
#!/bin/bash

# Ask the user for their favorite food
echo "What's your favorite food?"
read food

# Store it in a variable and use it
favorite_food=$food
echo "I see, you like $favorite_food!"
This script:

Uses #!/bin/bash to specify the shell.
Prints a message with echo.
Gets user input with read and stores it in food.
Declares a variable favorite_food and prints it using $.
